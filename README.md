# Linux_Scripts

### WHY

Admin scripts I use on my own computer, to make my life generally easier when existing. 

NOTE: These only include scripts that don't have security implications for me to release/have public. Some login/ssh scripts, webserver scripts, etc. are not here due to risk.

### HOW

Usually with python.

### WHEN

When something is irritating enough to automate it.
